                                    Yes, we take security VERY seriously so your online to do list is always protected.
                                    First, HTTPS is used to for all communication between the browser and our servers.
                                    HTTPS stands for "Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure" (quite a mouthful) means that all the data is encrypted/scrambled so no one can see your information.
                                    In addition, your information is password protected so no one else can access your information.
                                    We use  <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> for payment processing which is the industry leading solution. With Stripe, none of your credit card information is ever sent to us.
                                    Stripe receives your payment information and then provides us with a token showing that you've paid.

                                    Reoccurring to dos is a powerful feature in your online to do list.
                                    When a reoccurring to do is completed a new to do is automatically created with the correct due date.
                                    For example, if you have a to do "pay the cable bill" with a Frequency of Monthly, when you complete the item on October 2nd,
                                    a new to do is automatically created for November 2nd.

                                    Just separate each field with the "|" field
                                    For example:  "Pay Cable Company|10/15/2014|2|Bills" will add a to do named "Pay Cable Company" with a Due Date of "10/15/2014", a priority of "2" and a category/tag of "Bills"

                                    Definitely.  Each to do can one or more tags (also known as categories) associated with it.
                                    You can use as many tags as you like. There are no restrictions.
                                    There is a tag/category search that allows you to quickly identify all the to dos with the corresponding tag.
                                    You could tag a number of items with "HardwareStore" and then if you happen to be near a Home Depot... it's easy to see all the items you need to buy.

                                    The easiest way to do this is to get the data into excel (or the equivalent) and then "SaveAs a csv file".

                                    We've done a lot of research and decided that priority and due date should drive the order of the to do list.
                                    Priority is more important and is used to establish the order.
                                    If there is a tie in priorities, then due date will be used to decide which appears first.
                                    Priority is treated as the most important to focus energies on the items that are the most important to you.
