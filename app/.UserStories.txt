========== MVP ============
IN PROGRESS:

Need more instructions around import
Ability to set how long a completed task is shown
Picture in the stripe checkout
What do you get when you pay for it
Change To Do to Todo.. redo screen shots..
Update.. some places called 'tags' other places 'keywords' other places 'category'
When you enter a todo, or update one it is not clear how to add it.... should leaving the field update it?  add recommendation? should + sign call add function
GetAccountDetails - get the data from a real table.... remove hard coding from the view
Katie: Confusing to say "By Category" in the search/filter boxes
Date updates.... should these be considered valid???  8/31/14 (2 digit year),  7.31.14 (periods), etc
Katie: bypass registration by entering email and hit shift and pressing register (?)

Eliminate all cases where data passed into PHP module are used before sanitizing... OR implement PDO
Registration confirmation email (to verify account)... Create unique hash, email with hash in URL in email
Print formatting
Payment/Donation for usage using PayPal
Payment/Donation for usage using CreditCard
Tracking free trial period... enforcement of end of trial period
Forgot password process.... generate temp password & email..... Force password change when using temp password
Frequency logic.... For example, when completing a "Monthly" tasks do we add another
Add Content on Login and Registration Page
Show completed items... is this going to be a performance problem?  Should they be protected?
Feedback form... or Forum...
Export Todos - Should this be part of premium?   MVP?
Social Media Links.. Share on Twitter, FaceBook, "Like us" on Facebook... Tweet on Twitter ex:  "I'm getting organized on todogiant.com!"
Ability to specify priority/date on the quick add
BIZ STUFF - Terms and Conditions?   Privacy Agreement? I think they're needed
Build Unit Test Cases for Controllers and Services
Add Selenium test to grunt

Move session handling to dynamoDB on AWS
Add the ability to specify priority (maybe: Tags, DueDate, Frequency) in quick add (for example... New Todo|03/31/2014|Once)
Forum?
Ability to share todo lists... have two people log into the same list (change to data model, security (ie - which todo group do you want to share), etc)
Ellen wants the ability to move 1 todo between group

Pass back due_dt from the update service and refresh the scope (so "Mon" becomes 3/31/2014)
Settings.. Hide Todo Groups in NavBar... Show/Refresh when Exiting. --- Implemented by removing additional controller... so the setting page now inherits from the group controller in the NAV
Trigger refresh of TodoGroups in Nav when changes are made in Settings  --- Implemented by removing additional controller... so the setting page now inherits from the group controller in the NAV
Change Password         (SETTINGS)
