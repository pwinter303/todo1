========== MVP ============
IN PROGRESS:

Print formatting
Payment/Donation for usage using PayPal

Frequency logic.... For example, when completing a "Monthly" tasks do we add another
Add Content on Login and Registration Page
Build Test Cases
Dynamic congratulations messages for completed tasks... integrated with Tostr
Show completed items... is this going to be a performance problem?  Should they be protected?
Feedback form... or Forum...
Export Todos - Should this be part of premium?   MVP?
HTTPS - Need:  Certificate, Business Name,
Social Media Links.. Share on Twitter, FaceBook, "Like us" on Facebook... Tweet on Twitter ex:  "I'm getting organized on todogiant.com!"


BIZ STUFF
 - Setup LLC... Needed in advance of domain name, SSL setup, terms & conditions etc
 - Terms and Conditions?   Privacy Agreement? I think they're needed

Kudos for completing most todos
Android App
IOS App
Move session handling to dynamoDB on AWS
Add the ability to specify priority (maybe: Tags, DueDate, Frequency) in quick add (for example... New Todo|03/31/2014|Once)
Forum?
Ability to share todo lists... have two people log into the same list (change to data model, security (ie - which todo group do you want to share), etc)

Spacing on columns
Fix sorting in the Todo list so that rows sort after update is made (done... wrong field names in the filter)
Sort Priority - 9 is the highest and add description to the priority.name
Deploy on AWS
Home Page content
Register/Sign-up New User
Pass back due_dt from the update service and refresh the scope (so "Mon" becomes 3/31/2014)
Settings.. Hide Todo Groups in NavBar... Show/Refresh when Exiting. --- Implemented by removing additional controller... so the setting page now inherits from the group controller in the NAV
Trigger refresh of TodoGroups in Nav when changes are made in Settings  --- Implemented by removing additional controller... so the setting page now inherits from the group controller in the NAV
Change Password         (SETTINGS)
space out the change password fields on successful password change...
store database connection in session.... NOT POSSIBLE... "do not store any objects in session"
Move Todos between Groups (SETTINGS)
Add phpass for password storing... See: https://phpbestpractices.org/
Import Todos - Think this may be critical for folks to start using the app

========== CANCELED ============
DatePicker for DueDate - HORRIBLE performance with long lists and angular
