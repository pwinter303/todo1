Deployment Steps (Used Dec 5th, ):
* 01) grunt
* 02) Must MANUALLY update the images in meta og:image in index.html to point to the renamed image names! (get names from main.html
* 03) grunt s3
* 04) sudo ./creFolder.sh
* 05) ./deploy.sh
* 06) do any database patching
* 07) run Selenium Tests on test.todogiant.com
* 08) link prod to src
* 11) htmlSnapshot MUST be run (on LinuxMint) against the production site AFTER deployment.. then publish the snapshot_* files.. (Required so it points to the correct files (eg: minified images)
* 12) upload snapshots

OPTIONAL
X If New/Chg Pages:  Generate SiteMap --->  grunt sitemap       Manually Delete Pages that are no good.

IMPORTANT NOTE...
* Found that #!/demouser was not getting converted to escape_fragment by google... but #!demouser was (notice slash)
* then found once I corrected the above that google had error   /?_escaped_fragment_=/demouser.html  was not found 4040
* I was adding HTML to it so it was becoming demouser.html.html...    apparently google adds the .html automatically

2014-08-11 Deployment. Steps:
  1) upload files
  2) run deploy.sh
  3) patch database:  mysql -uroot -p db508430361 <DB.20140805.patch.sql
  4) run patch for data:   php dbRefreshTables.php DB.20140805
  5) manually added event and account_period records


2014-11-16 System Configuration Changes Needed for SEO... Redirect to Fragments
* Make sure site points to app folder in project directory (cant enter todo/app in browser or redirects will not work)
** above is done in http.conf in /etc on the mac.    000-default.conf in /etc/apache2/sites-available on LinuxMint
* npm update to install packages in package.json (eg: htmlSnapshot)
* Enable Rewrite
** LinuxMint:  sudo a2enmod rewrite       then     sudo service apache2
** Mac:  Uncomment mod_rewrite module in httpd.conf    then sudo apachectl restart
** Win7: Uncomment mod_rewrite module in httpd.conf    then Admin/Services/Apache Restart
** AWS:
* Setup rewrite condition.. On Mac:  in httpd.conf...    On Linux Mint:  000-detault.conf
        ####THIS HAS TO GO IN http.conf AND ssl.conf

        ##PLW strip www.
        RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^todogiant.com$ [NC]
        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://todogiant.com/$1 [L,R=301]

        ## convert googlebot escape_fragment to the name of the snapshot
        ## found that bots sometimes use .html extension other times it is left off
        ## this block is useD IF the html extension exists...
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}  ^/$
        RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^_escaped_fragment_=/?(.*).html$
        ## since .html is outside of the parens above it isnt in %1 so add it..
        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /snapshot_%1.html? [NC,L]

        ## convert googlebot escape_fragment to the name of the snapshot
        ## IF the html extension exists... it'll get trapped above..
        ##     so anything that reached here will NOT have extension.. so add it..
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}  ^/$
        RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^_escaped_fragment_=/?(.*)$
        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /snapshot_%1.html? [NC,L]

* On Mac & Win7 also had to change 1 other line change in httpd.conf
** Change AllowOverride none              to    ---->> AllowOverride All
* install curl to test...  curl http://localhost/?_escaped_fragment_=/faq


php extensions needed for stripe: curl, multibyte, openssl
uncomment in the php.ini file (for windows)
  extension=php_openssl.dll
  extension=php_mbstring.dll
  extension=php_curl.dll
On AWS:  sudo yum install php-mbstring  (I think this is the only one that needs to be installed)
http://www.knowledgebase-script.com/kb/article/how-to-enable-mbstring-in-php-46.html
install json_decode

linux mint... using package manager
install: php curl
